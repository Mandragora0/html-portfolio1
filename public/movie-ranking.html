<H2>My top 5  movies </H2>
<hr/>
<h3>DEAD POETS SOCIETY</h3>
<P> Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation." Don't be resigned to that. Break out!</P>
<h3>INTERSTELLAR</h3>
<P>Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</P>
<h3>THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY</h3>
<p>To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life.</p>
<h3>THE DARK KNIGHT RISES</h3>
<p>Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you</p>
<h3>EVANGELION</h3>
<P>Your Truth Can Be Changed Simply By The Way You Accept It. That's How Fragile The Truth For A Human Is.</P>
